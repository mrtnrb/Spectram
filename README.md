# Spectram

Toolbox for MATLAB(R) and GNU Octave for the analysis of dynamic spectroscopic data by SVD-based MLS. Spectram allows to deconvolute the data into transition models and their associated spectral components, which can be directly interpreted. Spectram can be applied to any desired spectroscopic technique and the applied models can be chosen individually.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

MATLAB(R) 9.0 with Optimization Toolbox
GNU Octave 4.4.1 (Optim package)

### Installing

Download or clone the repository. Add the destination folder to you MATLAB search path or Octave load path. For instance by:

```
addpath(folderName)
```

Open 'typical_example.m' for a short introduction on the usage and capabilities of Spectram.
